# AI-Based Fruit Detection and Counting System for Precision Agriculture

## Introduction:

The project focuses on developing an AI-based system for fruit detection and counting in agricultural settings. It utilizes the YOLOv8 object detection model, to accurately identify and count fruits in real-time. The system aims to enhance precision agriculture practices by providing farmers with efficient tools for yield estimation and management.

## Usage 
Train the model using `training.ipynb` or just use the model.tf from this repo. 
Add the model path into `App.py` and voila you can see a GUI.
