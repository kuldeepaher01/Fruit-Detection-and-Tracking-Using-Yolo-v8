# AI-Based Fruit Detection and Counting System for Precision Agriculture

## Introduction:

The project focuses on developing an AI-based system for fruit detection and counting in agricultural settings. It utilizes the YOLOv8 object detection model, to accurately identify and count fruits in real-time. The system aims to enhance precision agriculture practices by providing farmers with efficient tools for yield estimation and management.
